### Description

This complete program prints check data onto checks using a holder to hold the check on a piece of paper and then feed through a printer.

Since each check is slightly different there is a designer that will allow you to move the fields around using point and click (drag and drop) or key in the position (in inches) of a preset fields.

Finally, a data entry screen to type your check data with Autocomplete function and print it.

Other items of interest: wizards, option screen to set default check design and printer and a simple help file.

The code in this project will show how to use the Printer Object to print lines and text in specific positions. Using some routines to select a control, move it on the form, and much more).

Credits:

* AutoComplete is from PSC (sorry, don't know who the author is).

* The moving of controls is from a sample on vbsquare.com (however, I made it into a class).

Some of the coding might not be "Best Practice" b/c it was a learn as I go project.

* Ruler code is from www.freevbcode.com
